            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>I just think it's kinda neat. It's based on simple trigonometry:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>00:00:00 is 0°, 06:00:00 is 90°, and so on.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, roughly, first quarter is late night, second is morning, third is afternoon, fourth is evening and early night.</li>
                    <li>Also, it doesn't require you to guess if it's AM or PM.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>so I happen to find it an elegant alternative to the "traditional" analog clock.</p>
            <p>Also I was bored, and it's not like things need a reason to exist.</p>
            <p>I also find the counterintuitive idea of a anti-clockwise clock amusing :^)</p>
            <h2>How?</h2>
            <p>I made a desktop version of this using Pygame, and this version uses PyJS and Pyjsdl to compile it to Javascript.</p>
            <p>Yeah, this is cursed.</p>
            <h2>It's showing UTC instead of local time!</h2>
            <p>Turn off the "no fingerprinting" setting in your browser.</p>
